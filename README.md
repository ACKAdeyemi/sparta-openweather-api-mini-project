# <p align="center"> Mini-Project - OpenWeather API </p>

Your task for the weekend is to build out a Service Object Model (SOM) for the OpenWeatherMap API. This is a massive API with lots of smaller services (Current Weather, UV, Weather Stations, etc). You'll need to sign up with your own key here https://openweathermap.org/api. I've uploaded the starter code in SDET/Week 1

### The SOM must have:

* minimum 3 services of your choosing
* minimum 15 tests in each one
* Each test should have its own method(s) in its relevant sub-class
be submitted by 9am Monday morning
* Normal Git flow required (protect master, Jack as collaborator etc).

### BONUS
* Build out another SOM for the Brewdog Punk API https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2
